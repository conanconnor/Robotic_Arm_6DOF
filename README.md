A fully custom 6 degree of freedom robotic arm designed, built and programmed from scratch. This project was created as a personal engineering project to explore building a functional robotic system from the ground up.

<ins>**Goals**</ins>

The primary goal of this project was to design and build a fully functional custom 6-DOF pick-and-place robotic arm that could automate tasks similar to those found on assembly lines. As mechanical engineering students, we aimed to gain hands-on experience, implementing what we have learnt from theory - from initial CAD design to manufacturing, assembly and motion control programming. 

Our objectives included: 
- Understanding the complete robotics development process, from design to a fully operational product. 
- Designing a cost-effective, strong and reliable robotic arm, using 3D-printed components and commonly available hardware. 
- Developing motion control software in C++ using the Arduino IDE, achieving precise and predictable joint movements. 
- Creating a foundation for continuous improvement, allowing for future enhancements such as better actuators, sensors, and advanced control algorithms. 

This project was intended not only to produce a functional robotic manipulator but also to strengthen our capabilities in practical engineering design, prototyping and problem solving which are all key skills for any career in engineering. 

<ins>**Challenges**</ins>

Throughout the development process, we encountered several challenges, these include: 
- 3D printing tolerances: Very small holes and tight fit features designed in SolidWorks did not print accurately due to printer tolerances. 
- Support structure impact: Parts that required a lot of supports experienced surface imperfections or dimensional inaccuracies, affecting the assembly and motion smoothness. 
- Gravity and print orientation: Some components sagged during printing due to poor orientation or insufficient support. 
- Friction and mechanical losses: The gear system in the hand experienced higher friction than expected, reducing efficiency and motion smoothness. 
- Assembly complexity: Some components were difficult to fit together because accessibility was not fully considered during design. 

These challenges gave us valuable insight into Design for Manufacturing, specifically for additive manufacturing and low-cost robotics. 

<ins>**Solutions and Results**</ins>

To address these issues, we applied these solutions: 
- Drilling:  We used a hand drill to enlarge holes that printed undersized or not at all. 
- Sanding:  We sanded mating surfaces to improve fit and sliding motion. 
- Iterative redesign: Updated CAD models to correct structural or functional issues identified during testing. 

<ins>**Future Improvements**</ins>

If we were to continue developing this project or rebuild it from scratch we would add the following improvements: 
- Increase hole diameters in CAD to account for 3D-printing tolerances and avoid designing holes smaller than ~1 mm. 
- Optimise part geometry to reduce or eliminate the need for complex support structures. 
- Redesign print orientations to prevent sagging and ensure critical surfaces are printed cleanly. 
- Improve assembly by adding better access to screw holes 
- Refine the hand by redesigning gears to reduce friction and improve durability. 
- Upgrade control hardware in the future such as better servos, encoders or stepper motors for greater accuracy and load capacity.
